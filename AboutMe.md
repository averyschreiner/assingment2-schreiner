# Avery Schreiner
I am studying computer science at Northwest Missouri State University.
I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, playing chess, and being around my friends.
I am an RA on the 4th floor of Perrin, and I am on the varsity Esports team for Rocket League.
I am learning more and more about computer science and software engineering, and I look forward to what the future holds.
